;
; Ported to C++ in 1994.
; Multithreading added in 1998.
;
; This program takes a list of constants you specify in this config file
; and finds any valid equations relating those constants.
;
; The units (dimensions) of each constant (meters, kilograms, amperes,
; seconds) are honored when testing equations for validity.
;
; That is, the program will try many possible equations containing the
; constants you specify, but display only those equations in
; which the units of the constants all cancel.
;
; The program tries equations of the form:
;
; K1^E1  *  K2^E2  *  K3^E3 = unitless magnitude?
;
; Where
; Kn    is a constant
; En    is an integral exponent.
;
; For example, if you give the program the permittivity (p) and
; permeability (u) of free space, and the speed of light (c), and
; you specify that exponents should be tried from -2 to 2,
; then the program will test the following equations for validity:
;
; p^-2  *  u^-2  *  c^-2    =   unitless magnitude?
; p^-2  *  u^-2  *  c^-1    =   unitless magnitude?
; p^-2  *  u^-2  *  c^0     =   unitless magnitude?
; p^-2  *  u^-2  *  c^1     =   unitless magnitude?
; p^-2  *  u^-2  *  c^2     =   unitless magnitude?
; p^-2  *  u^-1  *  c^-2    =   unitless magnitude?
; p^-2  *  u^-1  *  c^-1    =   unitless magnitude?
;  --etc--
;
; Within a few milliseconds the program will discover Maxwells solution for the
; speed of light:
;
; p^-1  *  u^-1  *  c^2    ==   1.000 (no units)
;
; .. and display it for the user.
;
; see below for descriptions of each possible parameter that can be specified in
; this config file.
;
;
;----------------------------------------------------------
;
; The program reads this file to obtain the MaxExponent, MagnitudeDeviation, and
; constant vectors.
;
; Edit the below lines as desired:

; For each vector, try exponents between -MaxExponent and +MaxExponent
MaxExponent=3


; Show only equations whose result is within this ratio of 1.
MagnitudeDeviation=1.001


; Here are the vectors (constants) to try in the equation
; (columns are separated by any number of whitespace characters)
; You can specify as many constants as you want, and use any sumbol you want
; for a constant.
